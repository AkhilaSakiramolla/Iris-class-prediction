# knn-from-scratch
Implementation of K-Nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch on Iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

Problem statement:

• In this implementation, you need to make it in an opposite way: the training data is labeled as D and start with Dk = D, during each iteration, remove the data point which has the farthest distance from the query point until Dk has k points left.

• Implement a heap to make it faster for the search.
